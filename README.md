# ESP8266 NodeMCU with HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
Ultrasonic Snesor manual for the ESP8266 NodeMCU. This project is commissioned by my IOT teachers, during this manual i will be working with the Arduino software.
At the end of this manual you will be able to measure the distance of a object using the HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor.
# Supplies
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
